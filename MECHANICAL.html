<h1>MECHANICAL DEPARTMENT</h1>
</head>
<p> Mechanical Engineering activities at the Indian Institute of Science commenced 
prior to the Independence, in 1945, with the establishment of the Department of
 Internal Combustion Engineering. The Mechanical Engineering section of Power Engineering
 Department followed suit in 1951, and later became a full fledged Department. The Department 
 of Internal Combustion Engineering merged with the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1970.
 The classrooms, laboratories and offices of the department are located at the South-East end of the 
 Campus in three buildings — the Power Engineering Building, the TPS Building and the New Mechanical Engineering Building.<br><br><br>
