<h1>I'm GREAT TRAVELLER</h1>
<p> Travelling means going from one place to another in different purposes.
 They also explore to see the unseen and know the unknown. The travellers 
 always travel the most beautiful places of the world which uphold the existence 
 of nature. All things are created by Allah. There are many means to see the unseen
 and know the unknown, but travelling is the best of all. For example: Reading books
 gives us literal knowledge, listening story gives us indefinite ideas, but travelling
 gives us visual as well as concrete knowledge. At the same time, people do not travel
 in the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels
 for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. There are different types of travelling 
 like- travelling by air, bus, boat, train, bus etc. Every travelling has much educative
 value. It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without
 travelling. For this reason, we can learn many things by travelling. It teaches us trade and 
 commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore, the
 educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides, there are some special benefits
 of travelling. If a man stays at one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous and his life 
 becomes boring and callous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. Similarly,
 it also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveler can easily educate others.
 He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of other country. I like travelling very much.</p>
